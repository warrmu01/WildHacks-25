# üëÄ The Watcher : Your Snarky Productivity Coach

The Watcher is a Chrome extension that keeps your productivity in check with a twist ‚Äî sarcasm, banter, and a GPT-style AI coach that knows when you're *actually* getting things done‚Ä¶ and when you're just pretending.

Built for [Wild Hacks 2025], this project uses **Gemini AI**, **Google Calendar API**, and **OAuth** to deliver real-time coaching based on your task schedule and tab activity.

## üî• Features

- ‚úÖ **AI Coach Avatar**: A draggable coach that appears on-screen when it's task time ‚Äî and disappears when you're free.
- üóìÔ∏è **Google Calendar Integration**: Syncs with your calendar to track productivity windows.
- üß† **Gemini API**: Powers the coach's witty feedback, motivational nudges, and sarcastic commentary.
- üëÄ **Tab Tracking (Chrome Extension)**: Monitors tab usage to detect procrastination (Reddit, YouTube, etc... we see you).
- üìù **To-Do Tracking (Coming Soon)**: Manage and sync tasks for smarter productivity suggestions.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **OAuth Login** via Google for Calendar access.
2. Coach avatar loads during active task blocks.
3. Extension monitors current tabs and time.
4. **Gemini API** is called to generate personalized banter based on:
   - Your current task
   - Whether you‚Äôre on-task or procrastinating
5. Avatar disappears when your focus session ends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, CSS (Chrome Extension)
- **AI Integration**: Gemini API
- **Auth & Calendar**: Google OAuth + Google Calendar API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in progress. Chrome Extension only for now.

1. Clone this repo
2. Load the `extension/` folder as an **unpacked extension** in Chrome
3. Set up your `.env` for Gemini + Google APIs
4. Authenticate with Google
5. Start procrastinating ‚Äî we‚Äôll be watching üòè

## üí° Inspiration

We wanted to solve a real problem: staying focused when working alone. Instead of boring Pomodoro timers or productivity apps, we imagined a sarcastic AI coach that *feels* like your chaotic friend yelling at you to get back to work.
